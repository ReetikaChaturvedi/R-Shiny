I took traffic collision data that has the information of collisions that took place from 2010 to 2016. 
This data was published by Massachusetts Police Department. The questions that I addressed are as follows: •	Where are most of the collisions taking place? •	When are the collisions taking place? (which day) •	At what time the collisions are taking place?
